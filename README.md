# SLSN_Ic_hosts
Our project comparing metallicities and SFRs of PTF SLSN, Ic, Ic-BL and SN-GRB hosts

This repo contains the code to generate all plots and tables comparing PTF SLSN/Ic/Ic-BL host galaxies. All the files in this repo are described in this README file. 

Most of the original data (e.g. SLSN fluxes and metallicities from Perley et al. 2016) is also contained in this directory, along with scripts to convert the original tables do formats suitable for processing with pyMCZ and other code.
